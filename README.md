# GitandGithub Task 
## Part 1: Theoretical Questions 
### What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
  - Git: A Distributed version control system (handels versions)
    * It intellegently tracks changes in files 
    * Takes care of you projects history 
  - GitHub: A platform to showcase you projects and sources.
    + It is a cloud-based platfrom to store, and collaboratively share your work
    + It is bulit upon git and it simplifies using git in some cases 
  ##### The difference: 
  Git is the System that takes care of you project hitory, while Github is one of the many online repo hosting platforms
  Github is bulit upon git, and you can mostly use git without github
### Explain the difference between 'git pull' and 'git fetch'
  - Both commands retrieve code from remote repo but serves distinct purposes
    - git pull -> retrieve  changes from the remote repo and direclty merge them to the working directory 
    - git fetch -> retrieve changes from the remote repo without merging into the current working directory
### What is the purpose of .gitignore file ?
  .gitignore file contain the list of files that i want git to ignore when i make a commit
### Describe the steps to contribute to an open-source project on GitHub
  1. Find the repo you want to contribute to on GitHub
  2. Fork the repo (project) which will copy the same exact repo to your github
  3. clone the repo to your local device
  4. Add you modifications and push it back to your remote repo
  5. create a pull request where you merge from "your work" into "open-source"
  6. Your request will either be accepted or rejected by the open-source repo owner

### Task Summary
  In this task we recaped the main terms in the git and github world, defining, explaining and distinguishing between them. Additionally we tackeld the main git commands such as; clone, push, pull, fork and much more.
